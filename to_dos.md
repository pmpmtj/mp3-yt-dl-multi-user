I'll explore your codebase to understand the current state and identify what's missing for multiuser functionality in your YouTube downloader app.

Based on my analysis of your codebase, I can see you have a solid foundation for multiuser functionality, but there are several key components missing. Here's what you have and what's missing:

## **What You Have (Good Foundation):**

✅ **Session Management**: `UserContext` class with UUID-based session isolation  
✅ **Path Management**: Hierarchical directory structure (`session_uuid/video_uuid/media_type/`)  
✅ **Configuration**: Centralized config with feature flags  
✅ **Logging**: Structured logging with rotation  
✅ **UUID Generation**: Session and video UUID utilities  
✅ **Dependencies**: `yt-dlp` for YouTube downloads  

## **What's Missing for Complete Multiuser Functionality:**

### 1. **Core Download Engine** 
- No actual YouTube download logic using `yt-dlp`
- No audio/video/transcript download implementations
- No download progress tracking per user session

### 2. **Session Persistence & Management**
- No session storage/retrieval mechanism
- No session cleanup/expiration handling
- No concurrent session management

### 3. **Main Application Entry Point**
- No main application module (like `yt_dl_app.py`)
- No CLI interface or web interface
- No way to actually run the application

### 4. **Download State Management**
- No tracking of download progress per user
- No download queue management
- No error handling and retry logic per session

### 5. **File Management & Cleanup**
- No duplicate file detection across sessions
- No storage quota management per user
- No cleanup of completed/failed downloads

### 6. **Concurrent User Support**
- No thread/async safety for multiple simultaneous users
- No resource limiting per session
- No rate limiting for YouTube API calls

Would you like me to create the missing core components? I can start with:

1. **Core download engine** using `yt-dlp` with user context integration
2. **Main application entry point** with CLI interface
3. **Session manager** for handling multiple concurrent users
4. **Download progress tracking** per user session

Which component would you like me to implement first?
